# Cognitive Distortion Helper 🧠🌱

I've created a C++ console application that helps users identify and reflect on common cognitive distortions using a Binary Search Tree.

My project blends computer science fundamentals with psychological concepts from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to demonstrate how data structures can be used meaningfully in mental health education.


## ✨ What my Project Does

- Allows users to log how they are feeling by choosing relatable thought patterns
- Stores each cognitive distortion in a **Binary Search Tree**
- Tracks how often each distortion occurs
- Displays the **top 3 most frequent thinking patterns**
- Provides a clear explanation and personalized advice based on the most common distortion

This is a **front-to-back beginner project** designed to be readable, understandable, and educational.


## 🧠 The Psychological Aspect

- Catastrophizing  
- Mind Reading  
- All-or-Nothing Thinking  
- Overgeneralization  
- Emotional Reasoning  

Each distortion includes:
- A plain-language explanation
- Practical CBT-inspired advice

- **Concepts:**  
  - Binary Search Trees  
  - Structs & Classes  
  - Vectors  
  - Recursion  
  - Input validation
